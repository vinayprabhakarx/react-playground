# React Practice Playground

This repository documents my daily practice of React concepts.
Each day, I work on a small, focused example to improve my understanding and consistency.

## Objective

- Strengthen core React fundamentals
- Practice code structure and component-based thinking
- Build long-term consistency through daily implementation

## What This Repository Includes

Each folder contains a single concept or exercise, such as:

```
/useState
/useEffect
/props-basics
/conditional-rendering
/forms-handling
```

Every exercise focuses on one idea rather than a full project.

## Learning Approach

- Keep exercises small and clear
- Improve readability and organization
- Reflect and refine code when needed
